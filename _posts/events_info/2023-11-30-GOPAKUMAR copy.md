Nowadays, even a common power converter can exhibit an increased number of active devices and higher switching frequency than ever to satisfy a higher control performance demand. This results in an increased complexity related to the control board, where usually a combined μC (or μP, DSP) and FPGA are both installed. Those two ‘actors’ require a completely different programming approach and development tools from those utilized by traditional boards. The course will cover the methodologies to switch to new graphical programming development environments, starting from a review and going into the most promising solutions.
